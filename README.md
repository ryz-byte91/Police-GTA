build police game gta style
I am and have been for some time, interested in trying to build a gta style game where you would be a police officer. You start out in the police academy and upon graduation of the tutorial you become a beat cop. You can pull people over, issue tickets, make arrests, make decisions whether to investigate further or to let people go. Some decisions will effect future actions and situations. Enough good calls and positive cases and you will get promoted to detective, all the way up to chief of police. There will be a main story line to follow but also random cases that you can encounter at different times and places. Possibly decide if you want to be a good cop or corrupt and help criminals. An online version might even be possible, again im thinking very similiar to grand theft auto style.
